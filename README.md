**Project Management App**

This is a basic project management application built with React, designed to help users efficiently manage their projects and tasks. The app utilizes modern React features such as `useRef`, `useImperativeHandle`, `forwardRef`, and `useState` to create a dynamic and responsive user experience, styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean and modern look.

**Key Features:**
- **Add Project**: Users can create new projects by providing a title, description, and due date.
- **Task Management**: Within each project, users can add and delete tasks, enabling efficient organization of work.
- **Project Deletion**: Once a project is completed, users have the option to delete it.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The app provides instant feedback, allowing users to interact with forms and see changes without reloading.

**Technical Highlights:**
- **React Hooks**: Utilizes `useRef` for managing references to DOM elements and `useImperativeHandle` for exposing functions to parent components. `forwardRef` is employed to pass refs through component trees.
- **State Management**: Uses `useState` for local state management, ensuring a smooth user interface and efficient handling of dynamic data.
- **Styling**: Implements Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a responsive and visually appealing design.

**Future Enhancements:**
- **Code Optimization**:
  - Implement the **Context API** to eliminate prop drilling and simplify state management.
  - Use the **useReducer** hook to manage complex state logic, improving code maintainability.

- **Design Improvements**:
  - Streamline the UI for better usability with consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes.
  - Enhance visual appeal by incorporating modern design elements and interactive components.

- **Responsiveness**:
  - Ensure seamless functionality across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
  - Utilize responsive design techniques with Tailwind CSS to provide an optimal user experience on all screen sizes.

- **Feature Enhancements**:
  - Explore additional features such as user authentication, project sharing, and notifications to improve collaboration.

This app serves as a foundational tool for project management and offers ample opportunities for further development and feature enhancements. Contributions and feedback are welcome as I continue to improve this application.
